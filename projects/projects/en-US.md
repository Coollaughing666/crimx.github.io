NUXT based static website.

<hr class="read-more" />

With SSR generated static pages, DOM can be rendered before JavaScript loading, after which Vue will take over DOM manipulation and routing is controled by Vue-router.

Nuxt-i18n overrides Nuxt default routes and adds locale prefixes to every URL. Description of each project is written in Markdown and transformed to HTML via [markdown-loader](https://github.com/peerigon/markdown-loader).
